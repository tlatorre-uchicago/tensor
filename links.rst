`Gravitation <http://www.amazon.com/Gravitation-Physics-Series-Charles-Misner/dp/0716703440>`_ by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler
    This book presents an alternative formulation of tensors as abstract objects. In some ways, this presentation is more natural because it avoids defining tensors in terms of an arbitrary basis, but most physicists seem to use the component notation. For more info see the wikipedia page on `Tensor (intrinsic definition <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_%28intrinsic_definition%29>`_

`Introduction to Tensor Calculus <http://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~dullemond/lectures/tensor/tensor.pdf>`_
    This is a great introduction to tensors.
