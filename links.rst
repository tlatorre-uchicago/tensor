`Gravitation <http://www.amazon.com/Gravitation-Physics-Series-Charles-Misner/dp/0716703440>`_ by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler
    This book presents an alternative formulation of tensors as abstract
    objects. In some ways, this presentation is more natural because it avoids
    defining tensors in terms of an arbitrary basis, but most physicists seem to
    use the component notation. For more info see the wikipedia page on `Tensor
    (intrinsic definition)
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_%28intrinsic_definition%29>`_

On the Internet
---------------

`Introduction to Tensor Calculus <http://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~dullemond/lectures/tensor/tensor.pdf>`_
    This is a great introduction to tensors.

`An Introduction to tensors and group theory for physicists <http://lens.lib.uchicago.edu/?itemid=|library/marc/uc|8899109>`_
    Another grad student recommended this book. I haven't read it, but there is
    a free online version for students. From the Amazon page

        An Introduction to Tensors and Group Theory for Physicists provides
        both an intuitive and rigorous approach to tensors and groups and their
        role in theoretical physics and applied mathematics. A particular aim
        is to demystify tensors and provide a unified framework for
        understanding them in the context of classical and quantum physics.
        Connecting the component formalism prevalent in physics calculations
        with the abstract but more conceptual formulation found in many
        mathematical texts, the work will be a welcome addition to the
        literature on tensors and group theory. Advanced undergraduate and
        graduate students in physics and applied mathematics will find clarity
        and insight into the subject in this textbook.
